# Bibliometric data for text entry research between 2018-2022

Bibliometric data for text entry research publications, retrieved from Google Scholar through a custom Python script, using the search term ["text entry" acm], for works with a publication year on or after 2018, excluding patents and including citations. The timeframe for our data collection therefore represents 4.5 years
as the data was collected in May 2022.

High-res images of network analyses on this data are also included in this repository.

This dataset accompanies our [paper](http://text2030.textentry.org.uk/papers/5.pdf) at the [TEXT2030 - Shaping Text Entry Research in 2030](https://text2030.textentry.org.uk) workshop, held at [ACM MobileHCI'22](https://mobilehci.acm.org/2022/).
